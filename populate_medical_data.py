        "content": """This systematic review examines the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in early detection of Alzheimer's disease using neuroimaging biomarkers. Studies show that convolutional neural networks applied to MRI data can achieve 94% accuracy in distinguishing between mild cognitive impairment and early-stage Alzheimer's. Key findings include: (1) Hippocampal volume reduction is the strongest predictor, (2) Combining structural and functional MRI improves detection by 12%, (3) PET amyloid imaging remains the gold standard but is less accessible. The research demonstrates that AI-assisted diagnosis can identify at-risk patients 2-3 years before clinical symptoms appear, enabling earlier intervention strategies.""",
